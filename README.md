# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using ML
Coursera Project Aug’20 – Oct’20
- Leverage credit card transactions’ data to ensure a customer’s financial security by identifying fraudulent transactions
- Utilized caret and smote family package in R to create random test-train dataset and balanced it using 3 techniques
- Employed Random Forest, Linear Discriminant Analysis & Naïve Bayes algorithms to predict fraudulent transactions
- ML model best predicted fraudulent transactions with an 87.5% recall by using the ADASYN-Random Forest algorithm 
- Models trained using synthetically balanced data had a superior recall performance than the original imbalanced data
