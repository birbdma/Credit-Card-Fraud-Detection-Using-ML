# Predicting-Credit-Card-Fraud-with-R
Course Project: Econometrics, Prof. Deep Mukherjee, IIT Kanpur Aug’20 – Oct’20
▪ Leverage credit card transactions’ data to ensure customer’s money safety by identifying fraudulent transactions
▪ Visualized, analyzed and preprocessed highly imbalanced dataset with class distribution as 99:1 (non-fraud:fraud)
▪ Utilized caret and smote family package in R to create random test-train dataset and balanced it using 3 techniques
▪ Implemented Random Forest, Linear Discriminant Analysis & Naïve Bayes algorithms to predict fraudulent transaction
▪ Models trained using synthetically balanced data have a superior recall performance than original imbalanced data
▪ Fraudulent transactions were best predicted with 94.5% recall value by using the Random Forest-ADASYN model
